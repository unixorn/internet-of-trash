## What product do you want added to the list?

Name and shame time. Please include a link to the product/service.

## Why is it trash?

Please detail what earned it its trash status. Possible issues include but are definitely not limited to:

- A product that previously had API access has been locked down to require you to use the vendor's crapware
- A product that previously had a free API to control your devices is switching to paid subscription
- A product that used to work in a local-only mode is being "upgraded" to require a cloud service or account to function
- An API that was usable to provide integrations to projects like [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) and [Hubitat](https://hubitat.com) has been disabled or removed
- Safety issues
- Security issues.
- Vendor has been actively hostile to developers using their API. Mazda sending a cease and desist letter to the Mazda integration author, for example.

If there are articles / blog posts / press releases describing why it's bad, please include them here too.

## Is there a workaround?

If there's a workaround (like attaching Hue bulbs to a non-Philips zigbee controller), include that here. If there are other products that can replace it, please include links. In the interest of keeping entries short, we prioritize links to products like opengarage.io that publish their firmware, especially if it has an open source license.

Finally, thanks for the help - the IOT ecosystem gets larger every day and one person can't keep up on everything.
